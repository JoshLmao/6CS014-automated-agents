# 6CS014 Automated Agents Assignment

Unity project in 2020.1.1f1 that contains three parts on how a single agent or multiple agents can navigate along a waypoint graph using different pathfinding algorithms such as A* and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)

## Part 1

A single agent using A* pathfinding to get from one location to another and return

## Part 2

Multiple agents using A* pathfinding to get from one location to another single location and return

## Part 3

Multiple agents using Ant Colony Optimization, as well as A* pathfinding, to create a path from a start location through multiple goal locations and then return to it's start location
